# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
#### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyse data from a range of Kickstarter campaigns to look for patterns of success or failure based upon the project’s launch date and goals. The client Louise is specifically looking for relevant data regarding theater productions, particularly plays. 
### Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
An analysis of the outcomes of Kickstarter projects reveals that projects launched in May and June seem to have greater success rates than those at any other time of year. The fall and winter months, especially December, are bad times to launch a new project. 
Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
An analysis outcomes based on their stated goals shows that the most successfully funded projects fall within two ranges: less than $5,000 total, and the $35,000 to $45,000 range. Success rates dropped substantially in the $20,000-35,000 range and projects with a goal of $45,000 or more have a 93.75% failure rate. 
#### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While the number of successful project launches in May and June seem promising and could indicate that is the perfect time to launch a project it is also the time period with the overall highest number of projects launched. Therefore the competition between projects is higher and the rate of failure is also the highest of the year. 
One difficulty encountered was in the ‘Outcomes based on Goals’ sheet. When checking the sum of the columns for number successful and number failed against the >0 check suggested in the demo video my numbers did not initially match. There were a couple lines with typos or where both > and = were not used and so a handful of projects were missed out. 
It was also tricky to include a column for ‘Number canceled’ with nil returns. I had to  confirm that there were no canceled plays and it wasn’t an error by me. 

#### Results
###### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
o	The spring is the best time to launch a new Kickstarter project

o	Avoid the winter holiday period to launch new projects

###### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
o	Most people are asking for less than $5000 to fund their theater projects through Kickstarter
o	Lofty goals of over $45,000 are likely to fail. People with project ideas that big shouldn’t rely on crowdsourced funding.  

###### What are some limitations of this dataset?
While the dataset provides a lot of qualitative data about the projects launched it doesn’t really give much of an idea of what makes a particular project successful or not. There are significantly more factors that go into launching a project than what month to launch it and how much money to ask for. If wouldn’t matter if you launched a Kickstarter asking for the perfect amount of money at the right time of year if the pitch and production of the request wasn’t up to par. Closer analysis of the most successful projects in the ‘plays’ subcategory would be useful.

###### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
What production types have higher success rates (do musicals perform better than plays? Are mobile games more or less successful than video games?). 
Popularity of particular categories or subcategories in different countries.
